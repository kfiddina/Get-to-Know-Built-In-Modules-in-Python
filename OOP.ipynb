        "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\". An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. Python programming language supports different programming approaches like functional programming, modular programming. One of the popular approaches is object-oriented programming (OOP) to solve a programming problem is by creating objects."
